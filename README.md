**flambo** is a content reader/aggregator.

## Features

- Groups to help grouping data by topic
- Collections to let users manage their very own feed
- Sources pull data from various providers, for now:
    - RSS feeds
    - Meetup
    - hoping to add more in the future (contributions are welcome :))

## Components

**flambo** is made up of several components

- an *API* `/api`
- a *bot* `/bot`
- a *cli* `/cli`
- a *webapp* `/webapp`
- Node.js packages on which top level components depend

## Requirements

- docker
- docker-compose
- Node 7.6

## API

### Authentication

In order to perform calls on the API, you must be authenticated,
use the login endpoint to retrieve a token and then add an `Authorization` header
to your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
```

### Pagination

Apart from using standard pagination through `page` & `per_page` query parameters,
some endpoints use cursor based pagination, that means that you cannot jump to arbitrary
page, you must follow first query result to fetch next one:

```
# first call, retrieving first 5 users
GET /api/v1/users?first=5

{
  "edges": [ â€¦ ],
  "pageInfo": {
    "endCursor": "eyJzZXJpYWwiOiIxNDk0ODk5MzIyMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwNTEifQ==",
    "hasNextPage": false
  }
}

# then you can use the end cursor to fetch next users
GET /api/v1/users?first=5&after=eyJzZXJpYWwiOiIxNDk0ODk5MzIyMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwNTEifQ==
```

If you're curious, you should read [this documentation page](http://graphql.org/learn/pagination/)
from the graphql website.
